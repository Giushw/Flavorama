# Used Tools
This project is built with Vite, React, and TypeScript, using Mantine as the primary UI library.

For a streamlined setup, we recommend using the official Mantine Vite template (https://github.com/mantinedev/vite-template), which includes various features and configurations out of the box.

## Features

This template comes with the following features:

- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) with [mantine-postcss-preset](https://mantine.dev/styles/postcss-preset)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) setup with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- ESLint setup with [eslint-config-mantine](https://github.com/mantinedev/eslint-config-mantine)

## npm scripts

### Build and dev scripts

- `dev` – start development server
